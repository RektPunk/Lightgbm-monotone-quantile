# MQBoost Example

These following examples show how to set up and use `mqboost` for quantile regression with both parameter optimization and fixed parameters.
Adjust the parameters and settings as needed for your specific use case. To use the code, make sure you have `mqboost` and other required dependencies installed.

- `mqregressor.py`
  - Training with Fixed Parameters.
  - This example demonstrates how to train and evaluate the model with fixed parameters.

- `mqoptimizer.py`
  - Parameter Optimization with Optuna.
  - This example demonstrates how to optimize parameters using Optuna and then train and evaluate the model.
